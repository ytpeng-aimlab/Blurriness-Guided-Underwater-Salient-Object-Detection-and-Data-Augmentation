# U-SOD

Underwater Salient Object Detection (U-SOD) dataset, containing $1,111$ underwater images with various contents, backgrounds, and watercolors. 

# Introduction
As known, training data is crucial for deep-learning-based methods to succeed. Although many SOD datasets are available for terrestrial scenes, there is little data for underwater SOD, thus lacking well-acknowledged datasets for underwater SOD. As a result, we have collected 1,011 underwater images from the images or videos of \cite{HURL}, and \cite{BVision}, and National Geographic footage~\cite{NationalGeographic}, labeling their saliency maps. The collected images have different contents, watercolors, visibility degrees, and scales of objects to cover a wide range of underwater scenes. We label these images using an annotation tool for image segmentation implemented by Amaury Br{\'e}h{\'e}ret. Fig~\ref{fig:datasample} shows some examples for the dataset, where the first row demonstrates images with different object sizes, categories, and watercolors, and the second row shows the corresponding saliency maps we annotated.
